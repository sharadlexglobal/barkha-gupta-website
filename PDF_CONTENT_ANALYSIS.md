About Just People: Where Justice Meets Compassion

### Our Foundation
Just People by Barkha Gupta is more than a legal advisory service—it's a commitment to transforming how families experience the legal system during their most challenging moments.

Founded by Ms. Barkha Gupta, a retired District Judge with over 32 years of distinguished service in the Delhi judiciary, Just People was born from a simple observation: families navigating legal disputes deserve not only expert legal guidance but also empathy, dignity, and unwavering support.
